# Conclusion
Clustering of lyrics allows the identification of songs with more mainstream lyrics, more unique lyrics, or a combinatinon of the two. Also, between the 1990s and 2010s, there has been a huge increase in the prevalence of gangter-rap/hip-hop songs filled with expletives, and a noticeable decline in the uses of the words and themes such as "memory" and "remember".
